                <p>
                    Erika spent 3 years living in Nepal and serving at Beauty for Ashes. It was her 
                    journey to this nation that taught her to truly listen to Godâ€™s voice and respond 
                    in obedience. It was also in this time she fell deeply in love with Jesus and 
                    learned that He could affect and influence every area of her life.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    While Erika returned from Nepal in 2019 she has not forgotten what God taught her in 
                    her journey to Nepal and she continues to walk out these lessons in her life and share 
                    those lessons with others. She is passionate about connecting others with God and 
                    creating opportunities for them to hear His voice and have a deep relationship with Him.
